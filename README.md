## Installation and Setup Instructions
Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

Installation:

### npm install

To Run Test Suite:

### npm test

To Start Server:

### npm start

To Visit App:

localhost:3000

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
## Reflection
This project is implemented for Software engineering course at 1400/1401 Spring semester at Iran University Of Science and Technology. Project goals included using Agile methods, Front development, design patterns ... . Our group started developing this projec in order to ease process of reservation of parkings for any car owner and launching of parkings for parking owner.
The project is dealing with React JS, Web programming, UI/UX, testing, clean code and so on consepts. 
The technologies used here are React JS and its libraries like @mui, hooks, @bootstrap, react different components to make a good UI, react router, JSX , , axios and CSS.
